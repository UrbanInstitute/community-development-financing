### Styling

This page uses SCSS compiled by [Compass](http://compass-style.org/help/) into CSS. After installing compass (directions at that link), run compass in the root directory with `compass watch`. 

Edit the scss in the `/src/scss/` directory. Variables are stored in the `_variables.scss` folder, and the other underscored scss file is our default styles. Both are imported into the top of our stylesheet, `main.scss`. Any style changes should be made in `main.scss`. Styles are compiled and served from the `/dist/css/` directory.
